0: convnet

the most important parsed parameter is datapath, all other default values should lead to decent results
if one argument is changed from the default value, the output name will contain the change

example for a training run with 100 epochs, the adam optimizer with amsgrad, a specific data directory and live training output into a log file in the dir the script runs in:
python3 convnet.py -datapath='~/specific/data/' -totEpochs=100 -opt='adam_2' -verbose=1 >> trainingresults.log &

1: features

this script not only takes the image data as an input but also the tabular features files, which have to be in the class directories

the most important parsed parameter is datapath, all other default values should lead to decent results


	argument		type		default			description
	
	cpu				bool		False			performs training only on cpus
	gpu				bool		False			performs training on gpus
	datapath		str			'./small_data/'	directory which must contain classes as subdirectories with a directory 'training_images' inside
	outpath			str			'./out/'		(created) directory for the training output, a subdirectory will be created with the parameters of the run inside the name
	verbose			int			1				one of [0,1,2] for amount of output of training documentation
	totEpochs		int			10				total number of epochs for the training
	bs				int			8				Batch size
	lr				float		0.0001			Learning Rate
	height			int			128				Image height, must be the same as width
	width			int			128				Image width, must be the same as height
	depth			int			3				Number of channels (3 for RGB)
	testSplit		float		0.2				Fraction of examples in the validation set

so far, SGD is implemented and no data augmentation is performed

----------------------------------------------------------------

1: binary

this script takes the key argument which is the class that is going to be identified. It then takes a balanced mix from all other classes given by datapath.

for the cnn the optimizing methods 'adam' , 'sgs' and 'rmsprop' are implemented. For Binary classification, RMSprop seems to yield best results. Binary Crossentropy is the loss function.

1: analyze

this script takes the training output (the epoch log files) and visualizes them

the argument path is there for a folder with the title of the hyperparameter beeing changed and should have subdirectories of the individual runs with the parameter value in the names
